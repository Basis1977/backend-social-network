# Backend Social Network

This is a Backend application of a social network project used in my Youtube
videos.

## Chapter 1

In the first video, I've created the Maven project with Intellij and described
the folder structure and the pom.xml of the empty Maven project.

Then, I've converted the empty project to a Spring Boot project by adding the
Spring Boot dependency as the parent project. This way, my project will inherit
all the architecture and configuration of a Spring Boot project. After that,
I've also added a Spring Boot Web dependency letting know that this project
will use the Web layer.

Finally, I've create the main method, run the project and saw that the Tomcat
web server is ready to accept requests.
